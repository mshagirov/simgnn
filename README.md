# Graph Neural Networks for Vertex Dynamics Simulations and Parameter Inference
---


Tasks:
- Edit nb 4B:T_sim2real w/ posenc
    - implement x_e w/ posenc
    - test simple GNN training and pred for T
    - devise experiments to explore posenc
    - test removing norms in diffX (no posenc)
    - posenc with suitable diffX
    - posenc no diffX or norms (ablation tests)
